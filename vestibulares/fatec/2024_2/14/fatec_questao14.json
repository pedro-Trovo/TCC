Throughout the past twelve months, a cautiously optimistic outlook among analysts has become<br>increasingly common. Economic growth in 2023 is expected to end up at 2.2% somewhat better than the<br>1.7% initially projected, but still below the global average of 3.2%. Most analysts expect growth to decline<br>slightly to 1.9% this year, too little to decisively overcome the deep-seated public discontent that has been so<br>prevalent across Latin America in recent years.<br><br>Despite mediocre growth, political risk is declining and cautious optimism is increasingly warranted.",
